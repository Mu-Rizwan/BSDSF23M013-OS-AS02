Difference between stat() and lstat()

stat() follows symbolic links to their targets.

lstat() gets info about the link itself.
â†’ For ls, use lstat() to correctly identify links.

How to extract file type and permissions from st_mode

Use bitwise AND (&) with macros like S_IFDIR, S_IRUSR, etc.
Example:
if (S_ISDIR(st.st_mode)) printf("Directory");
if (st.st_mode & S_IRUSR) printf("Owner can read");
